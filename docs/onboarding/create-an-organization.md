## Overview

This article is a continuation of the onboarding series and is an optional step between [creating an account in PlanetScale](/docs/onboarding/create-an-account) and [creating a database](https://planetscale.com/docs/onboarding/create-a-database).
Here, we'll cover how to create a new organization from within the PlanetScale app.

Every PlanetScale database is housed within an organization, and each user can be a member of one or more organizations.
For more information on PlanetScale organizations, see our [access control documentation](/docs/concepts/access-control).
When you create a new PlanetScale account, a new organization be created automatically.
The name of your current organization can be seen in the top-left corner of the application.

To create a new organization, go to your account icon in the top right corner of the application, and click the small arrow to expand the drop-down menu.

After clicking "Create organization" the new organization will be created, and the application should switch to this one automatically.
In the top-left corner, you should now see the name of your new organization.
